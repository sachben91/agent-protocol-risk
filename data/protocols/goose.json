  "summary": "The most 'boring' protocol in the stack — and that's exactly why it's valuable. Born inside Block (Square, Cash App) as production infrastructure, Goose is a local-first agent runtime built on MCP. Its 'ordinariness' makes it the neutral reference implementation that AAIF needs. Like Kubernetes was to containers, Goose aims to be the boring-but-essential execution layer for agents. Low danger because it's explicit, auditable, and deliberately un-opinionated.",
