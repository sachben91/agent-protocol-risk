  "summary": "Perhaps the most Whitehead-like protocol in the stack — explicitly designed to keep humans in the loop. The 17 event types give users visibility into what agents are doing. But the risk is that 'human-in-the-loop' becomes performative — a rubber stamp rather than genuine oversight.",
  "kafkaIndex": {
    "feedbackLoop": {
      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Excellent. 17 typed events (lifecycle, messages, tool calls, state) provide granular visibility."
    },
    "edgeCases": {
      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Clean event model. Each type has a clear purpose."
    },
    "ambiguity": {
      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Typed events eliminate ambiguity. STATE_DELTA uses JSON Patch — deterministic."
    },
    "redundancy": {
      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Overlaps with A2UI. CopilotKit positions them as complementary but the boundary is blurry."

    "nesting": {
      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Flat event stream. No recursive nesting by design."
    },
    "exitCost": {
      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Lightweight protocol. Multiple backend frameworks supported. Switching is feasible."

    "identityPenetration": {
      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Low. Developers see it as plumbing, not ideology."

      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Explicitly designed for human-in-the-loop. Users can interrupt, redirect, cancel."

    "controlInvisibility": {
      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Risk: as agents get better, humans may stop actually reading the event stream. Oversight becomes ritual."

      "risk": "good",
      "note": "No urgency narrative. Positioned as pragmatic infrastructure."
