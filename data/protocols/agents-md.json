  "summary": "A deceptively simple Markdown file — like README.md but for AI agents — that tells coding agents how to behave in a repo. 60,000+ projects adopted it in months. Its brilliance is its simplicity; its danger is that it's becoming an implicit social expectation. Repos without AGENTS.md may become invisible to agents, creating a soft mandate nobody voted on. The protocol is already transitioning from 'explicit opt-in' to 'social expectation' — Asparouhova's Stage 2.",
