  "summary": "Specifically addresses cross-trust-boundary interactions — the hardest problem. Capability modules (payments, decisions, identity) are well-scoped. But blockchain dependency and NEAR ecosystem ties create a subtle lock-in that contradicts the open protocol narrative.",

      "risk": "good",
      "note": "Thread-based communication provides clear conversation history. On-chain verification."
    },
    "edgeCases": {
      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Extensible capability modules mean edge cases grow with each AITP-0X spec."

    "ambiguity": {
      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Cross-trust negotiation is inherently ambiguous — agents from different orgs may interpret capabilities differently."

    "redundancy": {
      "risk": "bad",
      "note": "Overlaps with A2A, x402, and AP2. Transaction capabilities duplicate x402's payment flow."

      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Threads containing capability messages containing structured data — 3 levels of nesting."

      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "NEAR/Web3 identity is strong. AITP inherits the 'decentralized future' narrative."
