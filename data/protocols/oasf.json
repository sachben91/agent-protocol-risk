  "summary": "An agent's 'resume' — a schema that describes what an agent can do, what it costs, and how to invoke it, so other agents can discover and 'hire' it. Part of the broader AGNTCY 'Internet of Agents' initiative. The Bartleby risk is real: the schema demands agents describe themselves in a highly structured way, which limits expression. Agents that don't fit the schema's categories become invisible. Like job listings that filter out unconventional candidates, OASF could inadvertently narrow what agents are allowed to be.",
