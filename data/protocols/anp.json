  "summary": "Philosophically committed to decentralization (DIDs, JSON-LD, E2E encryption). But Asparouhova's insight applies: decentralization doesn't prevent protocolization — it can make it harder to detect. And ANP's complexity (three-layer architecture) risks the Bartleby problem: too much agency demanded of participants, limiting adoption.",
