  "summary": "A generative UI specification where agents dynamically create rich interactive interfaces on-the-fly — not a transport protocol but a UI format. Framework-agnostic (React, Flutter, SwiftUI). The Whitehead promise is strong: agents that can show you what they're doing through real UI, not just text. But the risk is subtle: when agents generate their own interfaces, they also control what you see and don't see. The agent becomes both the actor and the set designer.",

      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Agent generates the UI that displays its own results — it controls the feedback loop. Circular trust problem."

    "edgeCases": {
      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Rendering across React, Flutter, SwiftUI from a single spec means many edge cases per platform."

      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "What UI an agent generates for the same task can vary. Non-deterministic presentation layer."
