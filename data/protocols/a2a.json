  "summary": "Well-designed enterprise coordination protocol. Agent Cards enable discovery without central registries. But 50+ corporate partners and Google's backing create a gravitational pull that may become hard to resist — the protocol could become the 'enterprise default' before alternatives mature.",

      "risk": "warning",
      "note": "Agent Cards lack cryptographic signatures — impersonation possible. Success/failure can be ambiguous in multi-hop delegation."
