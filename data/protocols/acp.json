  "summary": "The deliberately simple alternative to A2A. REST-native, no SDK required — works with curl. Multimodal (text, images, audio, video) via MIME types. ACP's design philosophy is anti-Kafka: reduce complexity, not add it. The risk is the Bartleby problem in reverse — it might be TOO simple for the complexity of real multi-agent systems, leading participants to bolt on complexity until ACP loses its simplicity advantage.",
