  "summary": "A Rust-based proxy that sits between agents and their targets (MCP servers, A2A agents, LLMs, APIs), adding security, auth, rate limiting, and observability. This is the protocol-level equivalent of a network firewall for agents. Crucially, Agent Gateway makes other protocols MORE visible — it's an anti-Kafka tool that adds feedback loops and audit trails where none existed. Paired with Kagent for Kubernetes-native agent orchestration.",

      "risk": "good",

      "risk": "warning",
