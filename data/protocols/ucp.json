  "summary": "The most ambitious — and most dangerous — protocol in the stack. 'Universal' commerce means UCP aspires to become the implicit protocol governing all agentic buying. Co-developed by Google and Shopify with Walmart, Target, and 20+ retailers. When the biggest players agree on a protocol, smaller participants have no real choice. The Bartleby risk: merchants who refuse to adopt will simply become invisible to agents.",
