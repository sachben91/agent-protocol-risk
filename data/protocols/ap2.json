  "summary": "Mandates (cryptographic proofs of user intent) are a sophisticated answer to 'did the human actually want this?' But 60+ corporate partners and payment-agnostic design means AP2 could become the invisible rails beneath all agentic commerce — an implicit protocol governing every transaction.",
