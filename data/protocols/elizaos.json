  "summary": "The most Kafkaesque protocol in the stack. A TypeScript agent framework with 90+ plugins, deeply integrated with blockchain, DeFi, and token economies. $ELIZAOS token ($20B+ ecosystem market cap) creates powerful financial incentives that make the protocol's control nearly impossible to resist or exit. Agents autonomously trade tokens, manage wallets, and execute DeFi strategies. The combination of financial identity, autonomous on-chain action, and token-driven governance creates a perfect storm of invisible control — Asparouhova's worst-case scenario.",

      "risk": "bad",
      "note": "Agent → LLM → plugin → smart contract → DeFi protocol. Deep nesting with each layer having its own failure modes."

    "agencyPreservation": {
      "risk": "bad",
      "note": "Agents trade autonomously. Users set broad parameters but can't predict specific decisions. Auto.fun democratizes agent creation but obscures what agents actually do."

    "controlInvisibility": {
      "risk": "critical",
      "note": "The most invisible control in the stack: token incentives shape behavior without anyone explicitly commanding it. You think you're 'investing' — you're being protocolized."
